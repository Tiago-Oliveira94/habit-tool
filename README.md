# habit-tool
A complete habit manager application with web and mobile interfaces. You can create habits for every day of week and track your progress in one of those beautiful and smooth interfaces. I did it to learn more about frontend and mobile, especially styling, smooth transitions, small animations and also learn some new nodeJS libraries.
