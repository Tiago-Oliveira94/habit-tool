# habit-tool
A complete habit application with web and mobile interfaces. I did it to learn more about frontend and mobile, and also learn some new nodeJS libraries.

To build this, i used technologies like:

- TypeScript: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript
- Prisma: https://github.com/prisma/prisma
- Fastify: https://github.com/fastify/fastify
- Zod: https://github.com/colinhacks/zod
- React: https://github.com/facebook/react
- ReactNative: https://github.com/facebook/react-native
- Tailwindcss: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss
- Expo: https://github.com/expo/expo


For Local Development:

 **Backend**

- to run the backend server, enter into server folder then execute 'npm run dev'

- to run the prisma studio client for manage database, execute 'npx prisma studio'

- to generate ERD from Prisma, 'execute npx prisma generate'

 **Frontend**

- to run the frontend, enter into web folder then execute 'npm run dev'


**Mobile**

- to run mobile app, enter into mobile folder then execute 'npm start', you can use the QR Code generated to access the application from a physical device or emulator through Expo Go App (available to Android/IOS)
